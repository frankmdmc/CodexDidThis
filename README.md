# California Scratch Ticket Expected Value Calculator

This repository contains a simple web page that estimates the expected value of a California Lottery scratch ticket. Enter the URL of a scratch ticket page and the script will attempt to parse the ticket information and calculate the expected value based on the remaining prizes table.

To use it:

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (or host the repository with GitHub Pages).
2. Paste the URL of a California Lottery scratch ticket in the input field.
3. Click **Calculate**.

The script scrapes the prize table and other details using XPath selectors similar to those used with `IMPORTXML` in Google Sheets. It then computes an estimated expected value by scaling the number of nonâ€‘winning tickets according to the ratio of remaining winning tickets.

**Note:** This tool relies on the structure of the California Lottery website. If the site's HTML changes or if cross-origin requests are blocked, the script may not work without adjustments.
